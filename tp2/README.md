## Project information

- The scene consists of a library room with a floor, a roof and 2 walls containing a painting, a clock and a silence warning. There is also a table with a newspaper, surrounded by some bookshelves. Additionally, a globe and a TV are visible, with some couches between them.

- The scene graph is configured following a bottom-up logic, processing each node and building the THREEjs objects from the primitives to the upper groups.
- Materials are built independently for each mesh to which they are applied, to avoid configurations from different contexts to a material that's being shared. Textures use the same logic.
- Different levels of detail are applied to the clock, the bookshelves and the couches (several levels).

- There are some advanced textures in cases like the skybox, the painting with mip-maps, the globe with a bump texture and also the TV with a video texture.

- The stick supporting the globe has the wireframe property on.

- The silence warning in the wall uses a polygon (buffer geometry) for its shape.

- The interface offers control over different cameras, the available lights and all the groups of objects in the scene.
- In terms of creativity, the scene tries to truly resemble the environment of a library room, having a moderate degree of illumination, a newspaper built using nurbs with a spot light above (and shadows), and the silence sign which makes sense in this context.

- The code is well structured, being divided into different files and functions. Also, code documentation is available.
